This is a semester-long full stack web application project that will call for the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and later on a backend. Currently, I am on part 2/5 of the project, where we have built the framework of the website using HTML and CSS and implemented some rules using JavaScript. Thank you for viewing!
